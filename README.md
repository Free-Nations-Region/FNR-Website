# FNR Website
ðŸ›‘ **Warning**: Website is still under construction!
## About
A website that is created and maintained by [Heaveria](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=heaveria) &
[Tigerania](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=tigerania) (Drehtisch) for various 
[NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) functions. 
While it will service many functions for [FNR](https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_free_nations_region),
it will also contain a plethora of services that will be available to and 
usable by NationStates players as a whole. Still under construction.

## Link
View the current status of the website [here](https://free-nations-region.github.io/FNR-Website/).
When development is finished, it will be transitioned over to an official FNR domain.

## Open Source
Some tools on the website can be executed completely through frontend code. Nonetheless, some functions
will be executed through server-end code via the FNR API. Nonetheless, everything will be open-sourced as development proceeds.
Client and server never store any personally identifiable information, and our login-system relies solely on the
NS Verification API.

## Login with Privacy
In order to deliver on our pledge of not collecting any personal information (to include passwords,) our login system is completely based on the NationStates Verification API. This means that you login to the NationStates website (your trusted source), give us verification code that NS gave you, and then we ask NationStates servers if you are who you claim to be. Easy and more secure with privacy in mind. An easy comparison, for example, is when you use a third-party login (e.g. Google) on any other website to login instead of signing up with an additional account which woukd add your email and password into a whole different database. 

# Features for Everyone
## Dispatch Backup
This tool is executed entirely front-end and allows you to back up all the dispatches of any nation. This whole process is also ratelimited to comply with NationStates API Rules. The ratelimit can also be manually increases by the user. The results of the backup can either by copied to the clipboard or downloaded as a .txt file. You must login to use this tool in order for us to properly comply with all NationStates API rules.

# Miscellaneous
## Donate
All of this development takes a lot of time, skill, and sweat. In addition, we must also maintain server costs.
We maintain a transparent open budget via the Open Collective platform. If you like our tools and would 
[like to help us](https://opencollective.com/fnr) out, we'd appreciate anything ðŸ’–.
