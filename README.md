# FNR Website
ðŸ›‘ **Warning**: Website is still under construction!
## About
A website that is created and maintained by [Heaveria](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=heaveria) &
[Tigerania](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=tigerania) (Drehtisch) for various 
[NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) functions. 
While it will service many functions for [FNR](https://www.nationstates.net/region=the_free_nations_region),
it will also contain a plethora of services that will be available to and 
usable by NationStates players as a whole. Still under construction.

## Link
View the current status of the website [here](https://free-nations-region.github.io/FNR-Website/).
When development is finished, it will be transitioned over to a official FNR domain.

## Open Source
Some tools on the website can be executed completely through frontend code. Nonetheless, some functions
will be executed through server-end code via the FNR API. Nonetheless, we plan to open-source whatever can.
Client and server never store any personally identifiable information, and our login-system relies solely on the
NS Verification API.

## Donate
All of this development takes a lot of time, skill, and sweat. In addition, we must also maintain server costs.
We maintain a transparent open budget via the Open Collective platform. If you like our tools and would 
[like to help us](https://opencollective.com/fnr) out, we'd appreciate anything ðŸ’–.
